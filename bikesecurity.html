            The National Bike Registry(NBR) is an organization which helps local authorities identify and return stolen bicycles to their rightful owner. The NBR maintains a database of bicycles and allows user to register their bicycles into this database for a small fee. Police departments can use this database to identify bicycles which they recover. The NBR also offers basic tips to secure a bicycle in a public environment to prevent it from being stolen. For more information on the NBR, visit their website which can be found here: https://www.nationalbikeregistry.com/
